# Installation Guide

### Dependents: HDF5 and TurboPFor.

- Install HDF5 (skip if you already have it)
  
  Please use 1.10.X (e.g. hdf5-1.10.7  https://www.hdfgroup.org/packages/hdf5-1107-source/). The HDf5 1.12 has issues with plug-in support. Below are some steps to install it
  ```console
  > tar zxvf hdf5-1.10.7.tar.gz
  > ./autogen.sh
  > ./configure --prefix=$PWD/build 
    # You may need "--enable-parallel CC=mpicc" to enable parallel version
  > make 
  > make install
  > export HDF5_HOME=$PWD/build

  ```
  If on NERSC machine or machine with HDF5 as module. 
  Just use the pre-compiled HDF5 
  ```console
  > module load cray-hdf5-parallel/1.10.5.2
  ```
- Install TurboPFor
   
  ```console
  > git clone https://github.com/powturbo/TurboPFor-Integer-Compression.git
  > cd TurboPFor-Integer-Compression
  > make
  > export TurboPFor_HOME=$PWD
  ```
   
### Install H5TurboPFor
  
  ```console
  > git clone https://github.com/dbinlbl/H5TurboPFor.git
  > cd H5TurboPFor
  > cmake .
  > make
  > make install
  > source setup.sh   ##setup the path to load the H5TurboPFor

   Note:
   (1) You may want to edit the CMakeLists.txt files for proper installtaion of TurboPFor
   
     set(turbopfor_ROOT_DIR $ENV{TurboPFor_HOME})
  
   (2)the default installation directory is set as $PWD/build.
    You can adjust it if you want

    set(PLUGIN_INSTALL_PATH "./build" CACHE PATH "Where to install the dynamic HDF5-plugin")
  ```
  
# Usage in Python, Jupytor Notebook, and C/C++

Note: please make sure you have ran "source setup.sh" and then start python/jupyter-notebook with the same terminal to avoid issues like ***"ValueError: Unknown compression filter number: 62016"***


### (1) Python 
 
```python
> python3 py-example.py
> h5dump -pH das_example_compressed.h5

HDF5 "das_example_compressed.h5" {
GROUP "/" {
   DATASET "Acoustic" {
      DATATYPE  H5T_STD_I16LE
      DATASPACE  SIMPLE { ( 30000, 21 ) / ( 30000, 21 ) }
      STORAGE_LAYOUT {
         CHUNKED ( 30000, 21 )
         SIZE 668260 (1.885:1 COMPRESSION)
      }
     ... ...
}}}
```
### (2) Jupytor Notebook

Please see the [H5TurboPFor-Example-Jupyter.ipynb](H5TurboPFor-Example-Jupyter.ipynb)  for the example

### (3) Embed in your C/C++ code
 
Based on the H5TurboPFor_HOME and HDF5_HOME set above

```console
> export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=$HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH:$H5TurboPFor_HOME/lib
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH:$HDF5_HOME/lib
> export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH may be needed only on MacOS
```

The blow is the minimum code to use the H5TurboPFor

```C
   unsigned int filter_flags = H5Z_FLAG_MANDATORY;
   H5Z_filter_t filter_id = 62016;
   hid_t create_dcpl_id = H5Pcreate(H5P_DATASET_CREATE);

   * @param cd_values: the pointer of the parameter 
   * 			cd_values[0]: type of data:  short (0),  int (1)
   *          cd_values[1]: 0/1 pre-processing method: zipzag  
   *          cd_values[2, -]: size of each dimension of a chunk 
   filter_cd_nelmts = 4
   filter_cd_values[0] = 0;
   filter_cd_values[1] = 1;
   filter_cd_values[2] = 100;
   filter_cd_values[3] = 100;

   H5Pset_filter(create_dcpl_id, filter_id, filter_flags, filter_cd_nelmts, filter_cd_values);
   endpoint_ranks = 2;
   filter_chunk_size[0] = 100;
   filter_chunk_size[1] = 100;
   H5Pset_chunk(create_dcpl_id, endpoint_ranks, filter_chunk_size);
   
   did = H5Dcreate(fid, "FNAME", "FILE DISK TYPE", "DATA SPACE", H5P_DEFAULT, create_dcpl_id, H5P_DEFAULT);
   
 ```
 

 ### (4) A parallel implementation specifically for DAS data is available in DASSA
